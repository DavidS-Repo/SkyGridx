#SkyGrid World Block Selection Guide:
#
#- Each line in the materials file corresponds to a block and its chance of appearing.
#- Format: BlockID:Percentage (use block names or IDs).
#- Example: "STONE:50" means a 50% chance of Stone appearing with in the 32 chunk distribution.
#- You can include as many blocks as you want, and their percentages can be anything.
#- The total percentage doesn't need to add up to 100%.
#- If no percentage is specified for any of the blocks the plugin will distribute the percentage among all the blocks missing a percentage
#- If you specify the percentage but for only some of the blocks and it doesn't add up to 100% the plugin will distribute the remainder to the rest of the blocks missing a percentage.
#- These percentages should be interpreted as a probability distribution for selecting the blocks. So, for the END_STONE:80, on average, you'd expect END_STONE to be selected 80% of the time in your block distribution.
#- You can use any of the materials in the bukkit Material page here https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
