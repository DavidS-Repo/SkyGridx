# SkyGrid End Block Selection Guide:
#
# This YAML configuration file defines the block distributions for different
# biomes in The End dimension of your SkyGrid world. The configuration is
# split into two main sections:
# 
# 1. biomes: Maps each biome to a specific distribution.
# 2. distributions: Defines the block materials and their respective percentages.
#
# Important Notes:
# - Each biome must be assigned a distribution.
# - Percentages represent the relative chance of each block appearing.
# - The total percentage for each distribution does not need to sum to 100%.
#   The system will handle scaling as necessary.
# - Ensure that all block names correspond to valid Bukkit `Material` enums.
#   Reference: [Bukkit Material Documentation](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html)
#
# Example Usage:
# - To assign the same distribution to multiple biomes, map each biome to the desired distribution.
# - You can define multiple distributions and assign them to different biomes as needed.
#
# Supported Biomes:
# - Refer to [Bukkit Biome Documentation](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html) for a list of supported biomes.

    # You can define additional distributions here and assign them to different biomes.
    # For example:
    # alternate_distribution:
    #   STONE: 40
    #   DIRT: 40
    #   SAND: 20
    #
    # To assign this distribution to a biome, add it under the 'biomes' section:
    # biomes:
    #   SOME_OTHER_BIOME:
    #     distribution: alternate_distribution

# Optional default distribution for biomes not explicitly defined in the 'biomes' section.
# This ensures that a fallback distribution is available.
