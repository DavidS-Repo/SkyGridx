# SkyGrid Nether Block Selection Guide:
#
# This YAML configuration file defines the block distributions for different
# biomes in the Nether dimension of your SkyGrid world. The configuration is
# organized into two main sections:
#
# 1. biomes: Maps each biome (or group of biomes) to a specific distribution.
# 2. distributions: Defines the block materials and their respective percentages.
#
# Important Notes:
# - Each biome must be assigned a distribution.
# - Percentages represent the relative chance of each block appearing.
# - The total percentage for each distribution does not need to sum to 100%.
#   The system will handle scaling as necessary.
# - Ensure that all block names correspond to valid Bukkit `Material` enums.
#   Reference: [Bukkit Material Documentation](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html)
#
# Example Usage:
# - To assign the same distribution to multiple biomes, list the biomes separated by commas.
# - You can define multiple distributions and assign them to different biomes as needed.
#
# Supported Biomes:
# - Refer to [Bukkit Biome Documentation](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html) for a list of supported biomes.

biomes:
  # Single-biome entry with its own custom distribution. To assign multiple biomes to the same distribution use comma separation like "SAMPLE_BIOME, OTHER_BIOME".
  SOUL_SAND_VALLEY:
    distribution: custom_soul_sand_valley
