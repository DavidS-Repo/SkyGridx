# mini_regen_materials.yml
#
# Define one or more “distributions” for mini‐chunk regeneration.
# Each distribution is a map of MATERIAL_NAME → percentage.
#  - MATERIAL_NAME must match a Bukkit Material enum (UPPERCASE, underscores).
#  - Percentages are doubles; they should sum to 100.0 per distribution (or use relative values—internally they’ll be normalized).
#
# Structure:
# distributions:
#   <distribution_key>:
#     <MATERIAL_NAME>: <percentage>
#     <MATERIAL_NAME>: <percentage>
#   another_distribution:
#     ...

distributions:
  # Example: a mining‐style mix of stone and ores
  mining_distribution:
    STONE: 70.0   # 70% chance to place STONE
    COAL_ORE: 15.0   # 15% chance to place COAL_ORE
    IRON_ORE: 10.0   # 10% chance to place IRON_ORE
    GOLD_ORE: 5.0   #  5% chance to place GOLD_ORE

  # Example: pure stone chunk
  stone_distribution:
    STONE: 100.0   # 100% stone

  # You can add your own distributions below.
  # Just choose a unique key and list MATERIAL_NAME: percentage pairs.
  # For instance:
  # frosty_distribution:
  #   PACKED_ICE:   60.0
  #   SNOW_BLOCK:   30.0
  #   ICE:          10.0
