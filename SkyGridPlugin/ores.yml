# Ore Replacement Chances

# This file specifies the chances of different ores replacing generated blocks.
# When lava or water generates stone, cobblestone, or basalt, they can be replaced
# with any valid block from the Bukkit Material list:
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html

# Format:
# Block_Type:
#   Material_Name: Percentage
#
# Block_Type:
#   - The block that is generated (STONE, COBBLESTONE, or BASALT).
# Material_Name: Percentage
#   - Each material name corresponds to the replacement block.
#   - The percentage is the likelihood of that material being chosen.

# Notes:
# - Percentages are adjusted proportionally if the total exceeds 100.
# - Comments starting with '#' are ignored.

# Example:
# If the configuration is:
# STONE:
#   STONE: 50
#   COAL_ORE: 50
# Then every time a stone block is generated, there is:
# - 50% chance it remains as STONE
# - 50% chance it is replaced with COAL_ORE.
